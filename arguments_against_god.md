# Arguments Against the Existence of God
Each of the arguments below aims to show that a particular set of gods does not exist — by demonstrating them to be inherently meaningless, [contradictory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_contradiction), or at odds with known [scientific](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science) or [historical facts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History) — or that there is insufficient proof to say that they do exist.

## Empirical Arguments
Empirical arguments depend on knowledge acquired by means of observation or experimentation to prove their conclusions.

- The [argument from inconsistent revelations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_inconsistent_revelations) contests the existence of the deity called God as described in [scriptures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scriptures) — such as the Hindu [Vedas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedas), the Jewish [Tanakh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanakh), the Christian [Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible), the Muslim [Qur’an](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim), the [Book of Mormon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Mormon) or the [Baha’i](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD_Faith) [Aqdas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kit%C3%A1b-i-Aqdas) — by identifying apparent contradictions between different scriptures, within a single scripture, or between scripture and known facts.

- The [problem of evil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_evil) contests the existence of a god who is both omnipotent and [omnibenevolent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnibenevolence) by arguing that such a god should not permit the existence of [evil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil) or [suffering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffering). The theist responses are called [theodicies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodicy).

- The [destiny of the unevangelized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destiny_of_the_unevangelized), by which persons who have never even heard of a particular revelation might be harshly punished for not following its dictates.

- The [argument from poor design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_poor_design) contests the idea that God created life on the basis that lifeforms, including humans, seem to exhibit poor design.

- The argument from [parsimony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsimony) (using [Occam’s razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor)) contends that since natural (non-supernatural) theories adequately explain the [development of religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_of_religion) and belief in gods, the actual existence of such supernatural agents is superfluous and may be dismissed unless otherwise proven to be required to explain the phenomenon.

- The analogy of [Russell’s teapot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_teapot) argues that the [burden of proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophic_burden_of_proof) for the existence of God lies with the theist rather than the atheist. The Russell’s teapot analogy can be considered an extension of Occam’s Razor.

- Stephen Hawking and co-author Leonard Mlodinow state in their book The Grand Design that it is reasonable to ask who or what created the universe, but if the answer is God, then the question has merely been deflected to that of who created God. Both authors claim that it is possible to answer these questions purely within the realm of science, and without invoking any divine beings. Some Christian philosophers disagree.

## Deductive Arguments
Deductive arguments attempt to prove their conclusions by deductive reasoning from true premises.

- The [Ultimate Boeing 747 gambit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Boeing_747_gambit) is a counter-argument to the [argument from design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_design). The argument from design claims that a complex or ordered structure must be designed. However, a god that is responsible for the creation of a universe would be at least as complicated as the universe that it creates. Therefore, it too must require a designer. And its designer would require a designer also, [ad infinitum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_infinitum). The argument for the existence of God is then a logical fallacy with or without the use of [special pleading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_pleading). The Ultimate 747 gambit states that God does not provide an origin of complexity, it simply assumes that complexity always existed. It also states that design fails to account for complexity, which [natural selection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection) can explain.

- The [omnipotence paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnipotence_paradox) suggests that the concept of an [omnipotent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnipotent) entity is logically contradictory, from considering a question like: “Can God create a rock so big that He cannot move it?” or “If God is all powerful, could God create a being more powerful than Himself?”

- The omniscience paradox contests further problems between omnipotence and omniscience, such as a lack of ability to create something unknown to God.

- The [problem of hell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_hell) is the idea that eternal damnation for actions committed in a finite existence contradicts God’s omnibenevolence or [omnipresence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omnipresence).

- The [argument from free will](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_free_will) contests the existence of an omniscient god who has [free will](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_will) — or has allotted the same freedom to his creations—by arguing that the two properties are contradictory. According to the argument, if God already knows the future, then humanity is destined to corroborate with his knowledge of the future and not have true free will to deviate from it. Therefore, our free will contradicts an omniscient god. Another argument attacks the existence of an [omniscient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omniscient) god who has free will directly in arguing that the will of God himself would be bound to follow whatever God foreknows himself doing throughout eternity.

- A counter-argument against the Cosmological argument (“chicken or the egg”) takes its assumption that things cannot exist without creators and applies it to God, setting up an infinite regress. This attacks the premise that the universe is the second cause (after God, who is claimed to be the first cause).

- Theological noncognitivism, as used in literature, usually seeks to disprove the god-concept by showing that it is unverifiable by scientific tests.

- The anthropic argument states that if God is omniscient, omnipotent, and morally perfect, He would have created other morally perfect beings instead of imperfect humans.

## Inductive arguments
Inductive arguments argue their conclusions through inductive reasoning.

- The [atheist-existential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheistic_existentialism) argument for the [non-existence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-existence) of a perfect sentient being states that if [existence precedes essence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existence_precedes_essence), it [follows from](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_consequence) the meaning of the term sentient that a sentient being cannot be complete or perfect. It is touched upon by [Jean-Paul Sartre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Paul_Sartre) in [Being and Nothingness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Being_and_Nothingness). Sartre’s phrasing is that God would be a pour-soi [a being-for-itself; a consciousness] who is also an en-soi [a being-in-itself; a thing]: which is a contradiction in terms. The argument is echoed thus in [Salman Rushdie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salman_Rushdie)'s novel [*Grimus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grimus): “That which is complete is also dead.”

- The “no reason” argument tries to show that an omnipotent and omniscient being would not have any reason to act in any way, specifically by creating the universe, because it would have no needs, wants, or desires since these very concepts are subjectively human. Since the universe exists, there is a contradiction, and therefore, an omnipotent god cannot exist. This argument is expounded upon by [Scott Adams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Adams) in the book [God’s Debris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God%27s_Debris), which puts forward a form of [Pandeism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandeism) as its fundamental theological model. A similar argument is put forward in [Ludwig von Mises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_von_Mises)‘s “Human Action”. He referred to it as the “praxeological argument” and claimed that a perfect being would have long ago satisfied all its wants and desires and would no longer be able to take action in the present without proving that it had been unable to achieve its wants faster—showing it imperfect.

- The “historical induction” argument concludes that since most theistic religions throughout history (e.g. [ancient Egyptian religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egyptian_religion), [ancient Greek religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_ancient_Greece)) and their gods ultimately come to be regarded as untrue or incorrect, all theistic religions, including contemporary ones, are therefore most likely untrue/incorrect by induction. It is implied as part of Stephen F. Roberts’ popular quotation:

> I contend that we are both atheists. I just believe in one fewer god than you do. When you understand why you dismiss all the other possible gods, you will understand why I dismiss yours.

## Subjective arguments
See also: [Anecdotal evidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anecdotal_evidence)

Similar to the [subjective](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/subjective) arguments for the existence of God, subjective arguments against the supernatural mainly rely on the testimony or experience of witnesses, or the propositions of a revealed religion in general.

- The witness argument gives credibility to personal witnesses, contemporary and from the past, who disbelieve or strongly doubt the existence of God.

- The conflicted religions argument notes that many religions give differing accounts as to what God is and what God wants; since all the contradictory accounts cannot be correct, many if not all religions must be incorrect.

- The disappointment argument claims that if, when asked for, there is no visible help from God, there is no reason to believe that there is a God.
