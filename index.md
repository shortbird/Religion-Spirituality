## The Existence of God

### Definitions
It is important to clarify the definitions being used for specific terms in order to avoid confusion. This list consists of the definitions I use for each of these terms.

<dl>
  <dt>Atheist</dt>
  <dd>A person who lacks belief in the existence of god or gods.</dd>
  <br>
  <dt>Strong Atheist</dt>
  <dd>A person who asserts that no gods exist.</dd>
</dl>

### My belief

I am a strong atheist, meaning I believe there is enough evidence to make an assertion against the existence of a god or gods. I believe that it is impossible to actually *disprove* god, but there is sufficient evidence to assert that there is no god.
