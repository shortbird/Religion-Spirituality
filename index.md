## The Existence of God

### Definitions
It is important to clarify the definitions being used for specific terms in order to avoid confusion. This list consists of the definitions I use for each of these terms.

**Atheist**  
A person who lacks belief in the existence of god or gods.

**Strong Atheist**  
A person who asserts that no gods exist.

**Agnostic**  
A person who believes that nothing is known or can be known of the existence or nature of God or of anything beyond material phenomena; a person who claims neither faith nor disbelief in God.

**Theist**  
A person who believes in the existence of a god or gods, specifically of a creator who intervenes in the universe.

**God**  
The supreme Governor of the universe and the Father of mankind. There are three separate persons in the Godhead: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. The Father and the Son have tangible bodies of flesh and bone and that the Holy Ghost is a personage of spirit without flesh and bone. [(Taken from the Mormon definition of God found here)](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bd/god?lang=eng)

**Worldview**  
A particular philosophy of life or conception of the world.

### My belief regarding god
I am a strong atheist, meaning I believe there is enough evidence to make an assertion against the existence of a god or gods. I believe that it is impossible to actually *disprove* god, but there is sufficient evidence to assert that there is no god.

### My Worldview
I am currently in the process of determining my worldview and which philosophy it best aligns with.

See [this document](/worldviews.md) that outlines some of my favorite philosophical worldviews.
