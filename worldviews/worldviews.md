# Worldviews
A [worldview](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldview#Philosophical) is a term used to describe an approach to addressing fundamental questions about the universe. There are [many worldviews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_philosophies) that can be based on one's attitude towards [life, ideas, philosophies, and religions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldview#Types_of_worldviews).

It is important to hold a worldview that best reflects reality. More accurate worldviews help us do more good while poorer models may inadvertently cause us to do harm.<sup>1</sup>

## Characteristics of a good worldview

- A good worldview can be demonstrated to reflect reality through logical analysis using the best scientific information available.

- A good worldview is completely non-dogmatic. Upon presentation of new or contradicting evidence, a good worldview will examine and incorporate new information to improve its view on reality.

- A good worldview provides a moral framework to aid in making decisions. This moral framework should promote balanced principles that help humanity live well together while respecting personal choice and helping those in need.
