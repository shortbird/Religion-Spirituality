# Buddhism
## Overview
Buddhism is a worldview founded on the teachings of Siddhattha Guatama, the historical Buddha.<sup>1</sup> The teachings of Buddhism can be summed up under the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path.<sup>2</sup>

For purposes of my specific search for a worldview, I am considering Secular Buddhism. There are two main differences between Buddhism and Secular Buddhism:
 - Secular Buddhists allow for a questioning of the literal interpretation of rebirth.
 - Secular Buddhists reject the appropriation of Asian cultures as part of engagement with the teachings of Buddhism.<sup>3</sup>

### The Four Noble Truths
1. Suffering exists

Life always involves suffering, in obvious and subtle forms. Even when things seem good, we always feel an undercurrent of anxiety and uncertainty inside.
2. Suffering has a cause

The cause of suffering is craving and fundamental ignorance. We suffer because of our mistaken belief that we are a separate, independent, solid “I.” The painful and futile struggle to maintain this delusion of ego is known as samsara, or cyclic existence.

3. There is a way to end suffering

The good news is that our obscurations are temporary. They are like passing clouds that obscure the sun of our enlightened nature, which is always present. Therefore, suffering can end because our obscurations can be purified and awakened mind is always available to us.

4. The path to achieve freedom from suffering

By living ethically, practicing meditation, and developing wisdom, we can take exactly the same journey to enlightenment and freedom from suffering that the buddhas do. We too can wake up.<sup>4</sup>

### The Noble Eightfold Path
1. Right Understanding

This is a significant step on the path as it relates to seeing the world and everything in it as it really is, not as we believe it to be or want it to be. Just as you may read the directions on a map, and then make the journey, studying, reading and examining the information is important, but only the preparation for the journey. At a deeper level, direct personal experience will then lead us to Right Understanding.

In his book " Old Path, White Clouds", Thich Nhat Hanh tells the story of the Buddha. The Buddha says "my teaching is not a dogma or a doctrine, but no doubt some people will take it as such." The Buddha goes on to say "I must state clearly that my teaching is a method to experience reality and not reality itself, just as a finger pointing at the moon is not the moon itself. A thinking person makes use of the finger to see the moon. A person who only looks at the finger and mistakes it for the moon will never see the real moon."

Knowing reality is of very little value if we don’t put it to personal use in our lives.  

2. Right Intent

This is the step where we become committed to the path. Right Understanding shows us what life really is and what life’s problems are composed of, Right Intent urges us to decide what our heart wants.

Right Intent must come from the heart and involves recognizing the equality of all life and compassion for all that life, beginning with yourself.

Right Intent means persistence and a passion for the journey. Setting out to climb a high mountain means you must understand the lay of the land and the pitfalls, the other team members, and the equipment you need. This is similar to Right Understanding. But you will only climb the mountain if you really want to and have a passion for the climb. This is Right Intent. The mountain we climb here is our journey though life.

To summaries, Right Understanding will eliminate ignorance. With Right Intent and correct understanding, we then remove desire, which in turn causes the suffering defined in the Four Noble Truths.

3. Right Speech

Right Speech is the next step of the Path. We tend to underestimate the power of the spoken word, and often regret words said in haste. Each of us has experienced the disappointment associated with harsh criticism, whether justified or not, and we also are likely to have felt good when kind words encouraged us.

Right speech involves recognition of the truth, and also an awareness of the impact of idle gossip and of repeating rumors. Communicating thoughtfully helps to unite others, and can heal dissention. By resolving never to speak unkindly, or in anger, a spirit of consideration evolves which moves us closer to everyday compassionate living.

4. Right Action

Right Action recognizes the need to take the ethical approach in life, to consider others and the world we live in. This includes not taking what is not given to us, and having respect for the agreements we make both in our private and business lives.

This step on the path also includes a whole approach to the environment, with Right Action being taken whenever possible to safeguard the world for future generations.

5. Right Livelihood

The next on the Eightfold Path follows on from Right Action, and this is Right Livelihood. If your work has a lack of respect for life, then it will be a barrier to progress on the spiritual path. Buddhism promotes the principle of equality of all living beings and respect for all life.

Right Livelihood also implies that a Buddhist who is able, will undertake some work, either as part of a Buddhist community, or in the workplace, or, alternatively, do home based or community service. Many communities of monks ensure that each member has daily chores, which remind him of this step on the Eightfold Path.

6. Right Effort

Right Effort means cultivating an enthusiasm, a positive attitude in a balanced way. Like the strings of a musical instrument, the amount of effort should not be too tense or too impatient, as well as not too slack or too laid back. Right Effort should produce an attitude of steady and cheerful determination.

In order to produce Right Effort, clear and honest thoughts should be welcomed, and feelings of jealousy and anger left behind. Right Effort equates to positive thinking, followed by focused action.

The Buddha was well ahead of his time on this one, and many books have been written about the power of the right attitude.

7. Right Mindfulness

Right Mindfulness means being aware of the moment, and being focused in that moment. When we travel somewhere, we are hearing noises, seeing buildings, trees, advertising, feeling the movement, thinking of those we left behind, thinking of our destination. So it is with most moments of our lives.

Right Mindfulness asks us to be aware of the journey at that moment, and to be clear and undistracted at that moment. Right Mindfulness is closely linked with meditation and forms the basis of meditation.

Right Mindfulness is not an attempt to exclude the world, in fact, the opposite. Right Mindfulness asks us to be aware of the moment, and of our actions at that moment. By being aware, we are able to see how old patterns and habits control us. In this awareness, we may see how fears of possible futures limit our present actions.

8. Right Concentration

Once the mind is uncluttered, it may then be concentrated to achieve whatever is desired. Right Concentration is turning the mind to focus on an object, such as a flower, or a lit candle, or a concept such as loving compassion. This forms the next part of the meditation process.

Right concentration implies that we select worthy directions for the concentration of the mind, although everything in nature, beautiful and ugly, may be useful for concentration. At deeper levels, no object or concept may be necessary for further development.

The benefits of Right Mindfulness and Right Concentration are significant as they teach the mind to see things, not as we are conditioned to seeing them, but as they really are. At the same time, they also lead to a feeling of calm and peace with the world. By being in the moment and being able to concentrate effectively, a sense of joy in the moment is felt. Release from the control of past pains and future mind games takes us closer to freedom from suffering.<sup>5</sup>

## Positive Aspects

The Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path is a fantastic framework to use in every day life. It is centered around mindfulness and living in the moment. Buddhism is sometimes misunderstood as a way to avoid or hide from suffering. Rather, it is a focus on removing unnecessary desires that lead to suffering. The fewer desires someone has, the less they will suffer.

## Negative Aspects

While I love the teachings and philosophy of Buddhism, I feel uncomfortable with the fact that the secular approach removes some of the major Buddhist beliefs such as karma, rebirth, and nirvana. It feels wrong and maybe a bit prideful to pick and choose beliefs from this 2,500 year old religion.

## Conclusion

While I love and respect the Buddhist way of life, I cannot accept the supernatural claims of the religion. Approaching Buddhism from a purely secular view feels disrespectful to those people who have valued Buddhism as their culture and religion for thousands of years. It is for these reasons I feel Secular Buddhism is a poor fit for my worldview.
